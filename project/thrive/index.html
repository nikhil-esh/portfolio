We worked on these issues for 4 months and then reported our findings in a presentation to faculty members, local stakeholders, and city officials.</p> 

				<p class="block">We had a respectable amount of research, concepts, and ideas. And our presentation was well received, as we anticipated. <span class="heavy-weight">But what we didnâ€™t expect was that our project would go on to become a viral topic of discussion, debate, and backlash for the entire city.</span</p>

					<p class="block">For the start of our project we connected with 616 Development, a local urban development company, hoping to get some insight on what it would take to bring a fresh food grocery store to the City Center in response to the growing market rate housing options. At the time, the average resident was forced to drive 20 minutes outside of the city merely to obtain two to three weeks worth of groceries (subsequently sending their money elsewhere), when this city is perfectly capable of providing a fresh food culture, in the heart of the City Center, where a new housing development sprouts up practically every month.</p>
					<p class="block">
					As designers, our first instinct was to design a really amazing experience. However, we quickly realized that would be too premature. We needed to understand the problem better; we needed to raise awareness. This is not solely a development problem or an economic development problem, it is an urban planning problem, a public health problem, and a transportation problem. This means that there is no clear solution, there may not even be consensus that there is a problem to begin with.</p>

						<p class="block">Before we could start to propose solutions, we had to fully understand the problem. And the obvious path to that understanding was to talk to the individuals that lived in and experienced the city everyday. We began a period of intense research, conversations, events, and surveys all aimed at the goal of understanding the problem more deeper and building empathy for our users.</p>
						<p class="block">We started this process by taking a look at the basic services offered in most towns and cities. We then mapped where they would fall on Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs, a theory of psychology that attempts to explain human motivation. And then based off this map, we surveyed the available resources in the Grand Rapids City Center and graphed them alongside Maslow's.</p>

So to gather these opinions, we set up an event and surveyed the student body of KCAD, which is located directly in the city Center. We collected surveys throughout the event and used this data to inform the rest of our project.</p>

						<p class="block">So I proposed the best way I know to communicate on this level, film. We gathered our core values and the opinions of the key outside voices we connected with to unite in a singular message.

					<p>These were hard words to swallow from a community of individuals that I believed I was truly advocating for. At first I viewed these comments as fringe-cases. There will always be people who have a negative view of any message. I demeaned them to the "Armchair Warrior" and "Angry Facebook User". But as it became more and more apparent that this was the resounding consensus of the entire community, I began to see that these weren't just edge cases. These were instead concerned citizens, frustrated community advocates, and members of under represented groups who we didn't make feel valued.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Ultimately, these reactions didn't render our work useless or invaluable, because it helped to contribute to a broader dialogue. But, we learned a valuable lesson. Design is about context, we designed a video that served a specific purpose, and when it was re-contextualized its message was lost. We never purposely sought to exclude individuals, but it was the lack of purposeful inclusion that ultimately harmed our credibility.</p>
					<br>
					<p>In the end, this experience proved to be an invaluable learning experience about the ways in which good, or bad design, can have wide affects on culture and the broader dialogue, for better or worse.</p>
